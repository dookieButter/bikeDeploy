Hello Friends,

This is an upload of what I use, which is based off of a script developed by Player2 on opendayz.net. Most of the relevant additions were made by Axe Cop, but this script is has gone through so many hands it is hard to track. If I miss credit for someone, let me know and post a source. The biggest reason I am posting this, is because when I rebuild a server... this is one of the most difficult things to track down how I did it the first time. I've tried to use other "improved" scripts, but after trying to apply them along with fixes... they still broke the game, or were dangerous.

Anyways, lets get this show on the road... GitHub frightens and confuses me anyways.
- Original source I found buried in here: http://opendayz.net/threads/auto-refuel-deploy-able-bikes.13707/
- Axe Cop's Contribution thread: http://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/3339-deployable-bike-scrollwheel-issue/
- maca134's right click option which isn't implemented... yet: http://epochservers.com/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=13

If someone finds the original source, link me... PLEASE!
